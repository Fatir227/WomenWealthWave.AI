# Introduction to Financial Literacy for Women

## Why Financial Literacy Matters

Financial literacy is the foundation of financial independence and security. For women, especially in the age group of 15-35, understanding money management is crucial for:

- **Independence**: Make your own financial decisions
- **Security**: Build a safety net for emergencies

- **Confidence**: Navigate financial conversations with ease

## Basic Financial Concepts

### Income
Money you earn from:
- Salary/wages from employment
- Business profits
- Freelance work
- Investments
- Allowances (for students)

### Expenses
Money you spend on:
- **Needs**: Food, housing, transportation, healthcare
- **Wants**: Entertainment, dining out, shopping
- **Savings**: Money set aside for future goals

### The Golden Rule
**Income - Expenses = Savings**

Always aim to save at least 20% of your income.
