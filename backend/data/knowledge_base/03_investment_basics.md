# Investment Basics for Women

## Why Invest?

Saving alone won't build wealth due to inflation. Investing helps your money grow faster than inflation.

### Inflation Example
- Today: ₹100 buys 1kg rice
- After 10 years (7% inflation): ₹100 buys only 0.5kg rice
- Your money loses value if it just sits in a savings account!
